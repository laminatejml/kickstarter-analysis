# Kickstarter Analysis
### Performing Analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends
##### I. Overview
Hello Louise, in an effort to help show you how your campaign has fared I have found a few new trends thay may help add some context to your campaign results. These will primarily concern kickstarter launch date times, as well as kickstarter goal amounts. With these you should be well equipped on any future campaigns you'd wish to undergo.
##### Undertaking & Analysis Pt. 1
When starting my analysis, I found the central challenge to be which data points to utilize, that would result in projections that were relevant to your inquiry. The first points I settled on were launch date times, and how they trend when measured against kickstarter campaign outcomes. What stood out once charted, was that the months of May, June, and July netted the most kickstarter goals, met. The months with the lowest amount of goals met were in November, December, and March. Most failed kickstarter campaigns were launched in the month of October, but at no point did the amount a failed campaigns surpass the amount of successful ones. Canceled kickstarters were miniscule and had no clear correlation.

##### Undertaking & Analyis Pt. 2
This undertaking was a little more intensive to chart out. I understood that measuring goal outcomes by goal amounts would be something of note, I underestimated the amount of time it would take to set the necessary filters using the COUNTIFS function on Excel. Nonetheless, the resulting data shows that the amount of successful kickstarters decrease as the goal amounts are increased. Specifically, we can see the percentage of successful kickstarters drop from 76% to 55% once kickstarter goals enter the $5000 to $9999 range. Please refer to the chart below.

##### Conclusion
In concusion for our Outcomes by Launch Date hart, it is apparent that there are more successful theatre kickstarters launched during the warm weather months (May, June, & July) as opposed to other times of the year. Second, from looking at our Outcomes Based on Goals chart, we can come to 2 conclusions. Firstly that kickstarters with lower goal amounts have a higher percentage of goals met, and second the higher the goal amount the lower the amount of successful campaigns. My only concerns in regards to this chart would be that due to a small sample of campaigns at higher ranges the charted percentages of kickstarters become volatile. With that said, I hope these findings serve you well in your future endeavors.
